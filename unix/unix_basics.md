## Architecture
An operating system (OS) can be defined as the software that controls the hardware resources of the computer and provides an environement under which programs can run.

An operating system consists of six differents parts:
- **Kernel:** Core of the OS, controlling the hardware and managing the processes.
- **System calls:** Interface between the kernel and the rest of the OS.
- **Library functions:** Common functions, using the system calls.
- **Shell:** Special application, providing an interface for running other applications.
- **Applications:** Everthing else.
